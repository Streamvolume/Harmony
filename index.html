        <font size="12" style="font-family: C; text-align: center;" color="#B60F6E">A Crash Course in the History of MLP</font>
        <p>
            <font size="10" style="font-family: C; text-align: right;" color="#B60F6E">T</font>o this point, we’ve discussed what makes a fan a fan and we’ve made it clear
            that there are fans of pretty much any interest you can imagine. But if you want
            to understand why sports fans wear jerseys of their favorite players, you need to
            know a thing or two about sports. Likewise, if you want to know why Star Wars
            fans wave around glowing plastic lightsabers, it helps to know a bit about the
            films. In the same vein, if you want to understand what it means to be a fan of
            MLP, you first need to know a bit about the show and its history.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be clear, this is only a crash course in the history of MLP. This overview is
            largely based on the work of others who have painstakingly compiled the
            fandom’s history based on hundreds of interviews, news articles, and memos
            from Hasbro, the company responsible for MLP. In particular, we highly
            recommend Sherilyn Connelly’s excellent 2017 book Ponyville Confidential:
            The History and Culture of My Little Pony, 1981–2016, which we consider to be
            the definitive reference on the history of MLP.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, the MLP franchise has existed for more than 35 years. Since then it has
            changed dramatically in its presentation, appearance, focus, and target audience.
            As such, the MLP that many bronies consider themselves to be a fan of today is
            very different from the MLP of the early 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something that’s pervaded the MLP franchise from its inception, however, is its
            overarching goal of selling children’s toys.
            9 The franchise was created, and is
            still owned by, Hasbro, which sells a myriad of children’s toys including Nerf
            guns, Play-Doh, board games, Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head, Easy-Bake Ovens
            and, perhaps most famous of all, media-influenced action figures (Transformers,
            G.I. Joe, Marvel). Throughout the 1980s, Hasbro created a series of television
            shows designed specifically to function as advertisements for their action figure
            lines. Nearly all of these toy lines, especially those promoted in television
            shows, were targeted toward boys.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1981, however, market researchers at Hasbro had begun to take an interest in
            a line of toys called the My Pretty Pony dolls. They were designed by Bonnie
            Zacherle, a contractor working for Hasbro’s research and development
            department. The dolls were ten inches tall and made of hard plastic, designed to
            be realistic-looking. They were targeted at little girls who often spoke about
            wanting their own pet pony and were found to spend a great deal of time
            daydreaming about horses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aiming to improve the popularity of the My Pretty Pony dolls, in 1982 Hasbro
            created a set of six smaller, more colorful versions of the figures. They were
            made with softer plastic and sold under the brand “My Little Pony.” The success
            of this newly-minted toy line led to the development of its own animated
            cartoon, which sought to grow their sales. The result was a 22-minute animated
            special simply called My Little Pony, aired in 1984. Two years later, a 65-
            episode animated series entitled My Little Pony ’n’Friends was developed
            alongside a full-length film entitled My Little Pony: The Movie. These, coupled
            with the 1992 series My Little Pony Tales, are considered by fans to be
            “Generation 1” or “G1” of the MLP franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
            G1 was a highly-effective commercial for the popular MLP toy line. As a show,
            however, it was roundly panned by critics. Many saw the show as nothing more
            than a shameless cash grab, devoid of any artistry or substance. Adding to the
            criticism, G1 took place at a time when the Federal Communications
            Commission—the government agency responsible for regulating television in
            America—was being pressured to crack down on advertising directly targeted
            toward children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond criticisms about the show’s intent, the show itself was also panned by
            critics. It became an easy punching bag for critics. Many saw the show as
            gratingly saccharine-sweet, with characters designed around excessively
            feminine stereotypes (e.g., long flowing hair, long eyelashes, emotion-driven
            plots). Even My Little Pony Tales, which attempted to be more slice of life and to
            appeal to the types of real-world problems that viewers would be more familiar
            with, fell victim to these criticisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 1992 the show stopped, effectively ending MLP G1. The end was due in no
            small part to the gradual decline in sales of MLP toys as popular competitors like
            Polly Pocket and Troll dolls came on the market. Despite its disappearance,
            however, the show would leave a lasting cultural legacy, one that would come
            back to “haunt” fans of later generations. The show would be forever
            remembered as a crass, cynical cash grab, a shallow, superficial series in an
            overly-feminine wrapper. This latter point was made especially poignant since
            the show was often contrasted against other popular, male-targeted shows such
            as G.I. Joe, Transformers, and He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. As
            Connelly put it in her book, the show became a cultural touchstone for anyone
            wanting to refer to a mindless, trashy children’s show.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the late 1990s and the 2000s, multiple attempts were made by
            Hasbro to revive the MLP franchise in one form or another. This included
            everything from McDonald’s Happy Meal toys to the release of computer and
            video games (e.g., My Little Pony: Friendship Gardens, where players took care
            of their own pony as a pet). Much of this Generation 2 revival, which lasted
            from 1998 to 1999, focused on reminiscence of the past, trying to capitalize on
            mothers who had grown up with G1 characters. There was, however, little
            attempt to modernize or update the characters to cater to a new generation of
            kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generation 3, released in 2003, was another attempted revival from Hasbro. This
            time, however, it focused this time on a newer, more innocent look to contrast
            itself against the heavily made-up Bratz and Barbie dolls of the time. G3 targeted
            a younger demographic (three- to six-year-old girls) than G1 did (a nine-andunder demographic). 
            G3 also changed its focus from being a toy line to a
            “lifestyle” brand. This meant going beyond watching the show and buying the
            toys. Hasbro merchandised MLP-themed books, bedding, bath products, towels,
            backpacks, clothing, and music, wanting the show to permeate every facet of its
            viewers’ lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            In what was perhaps the most important change for what would later become the
            brony fandom, the franchise revamped the way fans interacted with the
            characters. In earlier generations, fans saw the pony characters almost like pets,
            as characters to be taken care of or admired.
            In G3, however, backstories were written for the characters, who were given personalities and written to be more
            engaging. The writers wanted viewers to identify with the pony characters. This
            change would be amplified further in G4 of the show, marking one of the biggest
            draws of bronies to the show—the ability to identify with its characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2003, the first of a series of G3 films was released, called A Charming
            Birthday. It was followed by A Very Minty Christmas (2005), The Princess
            Promenade (2006), and even a touring live stage show called My Little Pony:
            The World’s Biggest Tea Party. While there was no episodic content in G3, it
            was successful in rekindling interest in the series and, more importantly for
            Hasbro, toy sales. It was also around this time that collector conventions such as
            the My Little Pony Collectors’ Convention in England and the My Little Pony
            Fair in Las Vegas popped up in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was at these same conventions that the media started noticing the occasional
            male attendee. This was also where the legacy of MLP as a trashy, hyperfeminized franchise reared its ugly head. These male attendees were often forced
            to justify their seemingly unusual interests, with media stories making them out
            to be deviants and questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite such setbacks, however, there were a number of important positive
            changes in G3 that paved the way for the subsequent generation of MLP. For one
            thing, numerous characters were created in G3 who would go on to appear (in
            modified form) in Generation 4. Perhaps even more important, however, in
            2008 the franchise limited its focus from a myriad of different characters to a
            “core seven” characters. These seven characters would ultimately be fleshed out
            and given a greater sense of distinct identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was during this time, when MLP was fighting against its legacy of being a
            shallow, treacly, hyper-feminine, cynical cash grab while simultaneously trying
            to make changes for the better, that G4 took shape. Lauren Faust, a veteran in the
            animation industry (e.g., The Powerpuff Girls, Foster’s Home for Imaginary
            Friends), was brought on as the creator of a new generation of MLP. This
            generation, G4, would go on to be called My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.
            Faust was a fan of MLP as a child. She sought to wrest the franchise from the
            negative aspects of its legacy while retaining the elements of fantasy and
            creativity it had inspired in her. Her changes to the show included greater focus
            on character-driven stories, developing fully fleshed-out, relatable characters,
            imbuing the show with complex moral ambiguity, and updating the show’s
            aesthetics and quality of animation. Faust sought to tackle complex issues within
            the show and to inject a feminist message into it. She wanted girls to see well-rounded characters with a myriad of strengths and weaknesses and to move past
            the cutesy, goody two-shoesness that had plagued existing generations of the
            show.
        </p>
        <p>
            The target audience was also far more nuanced and complex than it was for the
            original generations. Rather than appealing simply to young girls, Faust
            recognized that it would be important to foster co-viewing of the show—to get
            parents to watch the show with their children. She knew that many mothers—
            themselves fans of earlier generations—should be able to find something they
            found interesting and worth watching in the show. As such, the writers put
            considerable effort into targeting content not only to its youngest viewers, but
            also ensuring there was material that would appeal to tween and even adult
            audiences as well. This often included the clever use of cultural references,
            background details, and running jokes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was with these goals that MLP:FIM, Generation 4 of the MLP franchise,
            launched with a fresh new show and a brand-new philosophy aimed at toppling
            its legacy. The show itself launched in 2010, marking the first MLP-themed
            episodic series since My Little Pony Tales in 1992 on Hasbro’s newly-created
            Hub Network. This is where, at last, bronies enter the scene. Shortly after the
            initial release of the show in 2010, regulars of the popular Internet forum 4chan’s
            “Comics and Cartoons” board took notice of the show and began discussing it.
            At first, many were gearing up to give the show the same lambasting that critics
            had given earlier generations of the show. Forum members discussed the show
            with a hint of irony, watching it as a joke. Much to their surprise, however, many
            found themselves unexpectedly drawn to the quality of the show’s writing and
            animation, identifying with its characters and compelled by the lore of the
            show’s fictional universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short time, the term “brony” was used to describe fans of the show. The term
            was a shortening of the term “Pony-bro” commonly used on the site (a
            portmanteau of the words “bro”—popular in the vernacular to refer sarcastically
            to males—and “pony”). Not long after, the popular Brony news site Equestria
            Daily was launched. In short order, it found itself getting in excess of 100,000
            page views per day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fast and unexpected growth of this demographic—a proud and vocal
            community made up of predominantly young adult males from websites like
            4chan—did not escape the notice of the show’s creators. Faust herself personally
            thanked fans of the show, including bronies, on her DeviantArt journal shortly
            after the show’s initial release. The show’s creators and the brony fandom would
            continue to play off one another in the coming years. Bronies generated
            extensive amounts of fan-made writing, music, art, animation, costumes, and
            analysis and critiques of the show. The show’s creators would, in turn, throw
            nods and references to the brony community into the show itself.
            16 This is
            perhaps best exemplified in an episode entitled “Slice of Life,” an episode
            consisting entirely of background characters popular with the brony community
            —complete with characteristics, backstories, and personalities reflecting, in
            whole or in part, those generated by the brony fandom. Here they were, the
            fandom’s favorite background characters and recurring jokes, put front and
            center as the focus of an episode! A similar nod to bronies could be found in the
            character of Muffins (known as Derpy Hooves to bronies because of her first
            appearance in the show’s background with a googly-eyed expression due to an
            animation error). Muffins could often be found in the background of scenes as an
            Easter egg for diligent fans to notice (or, as in the case of the Equestria Girls
            film Rainbow Rocks, appearing less subtly in ending credit artwork alongside the
            film’s main characters).

            The brony fandom would continue to grow and develop a significant real-world
            presence, including conventions worldwide such as BABSCon in San Francisco,
            California, BronyCon in Baltimore, Maryland (which exceeded 10,000 attendees
            in 2015), and Galacon in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Bronies would also be the
            subject of several documentaries about the fandom, including the 2012 Bronies:
            The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony and the 2014 A Brony
            Tale.

            Unfortunately, media coverage of the brony fandom was largely unchanged from
            the judgmental and stigmatizing tone it had shown for male fans of G3. To this
            day, media stories about bronies tend to remain fairly negative, owing in no
            small part to the legacy of the show as trite, hyper-feminine, and a product of
            commercialism. As male G3 fans and attendees of MLP collector conventions
            were ridiculed by the media, bronies were roundly mocked by news media. They
            found themselves trivialized as immature or childish, had their sexual orientation
            and gender once again questioned, and were, especially online, treated as
            dysfunctional or suffering from mental illness.

            As a light-hearted example of the stigma bronies faced, Bill Clinton was
            “accused” of being a Brony after appearing on a 2011 NPR segment. On the
            segment, Clinton was asked a trio of multiple-choice trivia questions about the
            show. Despite having never watched the show, the questions were worded in a
            way that made the answers fairly obvious. The former president got all three
            questions correct and, for days afterward, was roundly mocked for being a
            “closeted brony.”

            As funny as it may seem to mock a non-brony former president for his
            knowledge of the show, the results of this stigma have far more dire
            consequences for bronies themselves. In 2014, two independent incidents
            occurred in rapid succession which illustrate the toll that stigmatization takes on
            the brony community. In one case, a nine-year-old boy attempted suicide due to
            repeatedly being bullied and harassed—including being repeatedly called gay—
            for liking the show. In the second case, an 11-year-old boy was bullied at school
            for wearing a Rainbow Dash backpack, something which he was told by school
            staff he could avoid by simply leaving the backpack at home. Both cases
            illustrate how the apparent acceptability of targeting bronies—especially male
            bronies—for liking a show “for girls” makes it socially acceptable for people to
            harass and bully bronies without consequence. On a more positive note, the
            brony fandom rallied together behind the victims in both cases, raising
            awareness, money, and support for the boys and their families. This is an
            excellent demonstration of several important norms within the brony fandom—
            kindness, compassion, charity, and acceptance.

            The brony fandom continues to exist, both online and at conventions. With
            MLP:FIM set to finish its ninth and final season in 2019, however, questions
            remain about the future of the fandom. With talks of a soon-to-be-launched
            Generation 5, many bronies find themselves wondering whether the fandom will
            continue, business as usual, following the new generation of the franchise, or
            whether the fandom itself will simply fade away.
